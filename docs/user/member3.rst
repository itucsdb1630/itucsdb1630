Parts Implemented by Memduh Gökırmak
================================
I have implemented the back end parts of Movies, Playlists and several relevant data types. Movies and Playlists are added through a form presented to the user, requiring them to input necessary data. The other data structures are meant to store data that is auxiliary to the main types, Movie and Playlist, and appear only on their pages.

A Playlist_Movie is an entry in a playlist. A celebrity is either someone cast in a role in a movie or a director. These do not have their own pages to be viewed on their own for the moment, but may be added in future versions of LightMDB.
